## Development

The project is directly hosted on github, so you don't have to compile anything
to start developping: simply open `index.html` in your browser.

Tests can be started manually by opening 'SpecRunner.html' in your browser,
but you have to disable CORS in your browser to run them.
They can also be run in the terminal using node 14 by issuing the `npm test` command,
and that is also the way how they are ran in continuous integration.
